# QR Code Generator

This is a simple and user-friendly web application that allows you to generate customizable QR codes instantly. You can enter any text or URL, select the size, and customize the foreground and background colors of the QR code. The generated QR code can also be downloaded as a PNG image.

## Features

- Generate QR codes dynamically based on user input (text or URL).
- Choose from multiple QR code sizes ranging from 100x100 to 1000x1000 pixels.
- Customize the foreground (dark) and background (light) colors of the QR code.
- Instant preview of the QR code while typing or changing options.
- Download the generated QR code as a PNG image.

## How It Works

- The application uses the `qrcodejs` library to create QR codes on the client side.
- JavaScript listens for user input and option changes to update the QR code in real time.
- The "Download QR" button saves the currently displayed QR code as a PNG file.
